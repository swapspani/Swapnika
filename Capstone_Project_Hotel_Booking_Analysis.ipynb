        "The given dataset is of hotel booking. I explored and analyzed the given dataset and discovered some important factors regarding hotel booking. For this, i first read the given data in my colab notebook and then understand the whole data like what are variables in the given data. After that i cleaned the data frame in data wrangling. For that i used some functions like drop(), fillna(), isna()/isnull() functions. Then i added some columns which are required in the analysis and removed some columns which are not required. The data set included customer booking information. As part of the analysis, descriptive statistics are calculated for each variable, and visualizations are created to explore the relationships between various variables. To get insight from the dataset, i build a variety of charts, including a count plot, bar plot, heatmap, pairplot and pieplot.The data set are composed of over 119390 hotel bookings, each containing several variables such as 'hotel', 'is_canceled', 'lead_time' and so on.. For this hotel booking analysis, the goal is to explore the customer data of a hotel and identify any potential trends or correlations. The purpose of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to explore the hotel booking data set and identify potential relationships between key variables."
